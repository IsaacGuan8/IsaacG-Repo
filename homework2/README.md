# Multiple Parent Inheritance with Time and Date
This small programs uses multiple inheritance from parents classes Time and Date to a child class DateTime. This also include a method that years, months, or days for Date class and hours, minutes, seconds for the Time class respectively. The default constructor for the DateTime object is set to January 1, 1970. This value is known as Unix epoch, which is a common reference point and makes it easier to calculate differences and perform date manipulations,  ensuring consistency. There is also a method normalize in both which helps when units overflow  and convert them to the next unit accordingly. There is also a method in DateTime that computes the difference between the two DateTime objects. The DateTime class includes a format method that displays the date and time in a customizable format.
